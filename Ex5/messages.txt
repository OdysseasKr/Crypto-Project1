Of course machines
can't think as people
do. A machine is
different from a person.
Hence, they think
differently. The
interesting question
is, just because
something, thinks
differently from you,
does that mean it
is not thinking?
Well, we allow for
humans to have such
divergences from
one another. You
like strawberries,
I hate ice-skating,
you cry at sad films,
I am allergic to
pollen. What is the
point of different
tastes, different
preferences, if not,
to say that our brains
work differently,
that we think differently?
And if we can say that
about one another,
then why can't we say
the same thing for brains
built of copper and wire, steel?
